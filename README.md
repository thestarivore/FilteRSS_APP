# FilteRSS Android APP - RSS reader with smart filtering

### Intro

What is FilteRSS? 

*Is a free RSS reader with filtering features for Android.*

The application we've built comes from the need to read news online in a simple and
effective way. In particular, we believe that being able to filter quality and interesting content
among the high number of articles published every day online, is a common problem nowadays.

The main components of the system are:
- **Server side part**, exposing a set of APIs, that are used to perform operations on a
relational database, which contains all the information about the user and the feeds;
- **Client side part**, the Android application, which tasks are to query the API, show
the gathered informations and provide users a point of interaction with the service.
The application is also in charge of gathering and parsing RSS feeds to retrieve and
show articles.

### Glossary

In order to better understand the features and functionalities of the application we provide
some definitions that should clarify some concepts of the application:
- **article** : It is the content produced by a feed. It has some properties, and the feed
decides which ones to provide, such as the title, the link to the page where the
content is published, a publication date, the content of the article, ecc. In the next
pages, we use content with the same meaning of article;
- **feed** : It is the content creator (e.g. “BBC”). It releases its content using the RSS
protocol;
- **multifeed** : it is a set of feeds. A multifeed is created and managed by the user (e.g. a
multifeed called “News” could contains different feeds such as “BBC”, “La Stampa”
and “The Guardian”);
- **collection** : It is a set of saved articles. A collection is created and managed by the
user. The user can decide to save articles storing them in different collections (e.g.
an article about a science discovery can be saved in the “Science” collection).



### Features

Here we list the core functionalities that can be found in the application.

    contains all the user’s information (more on this in the Data Design chapter);

- Multifeed:

  - the user can create a multifeed, giving it:
    - a name;
    - a color. The articles published by the feed that belongs to one
      multifeed with a color will have that color indication near them. In this
      way the user can easily distinguish if an articles belongs to one or
      another multifeed (more on this in the Application Design chapter);
    - a rating. It will be used in order to sort and filter articles (more on this
      in the Filtering chapter);

  - the user can view all the articles belonging to:
    - all the multifeeds;
    - a particular multifeed;
    - a single feed.

- Feeds:

  - the user can add a feed to a multifeed;

    textual search, and sort feeds by their category. The user can also sort feeds
    by language (currently only English and Italian languages are supported);

    browser;

  - the user can share the article (e.g. with a messaging app);

  - the user can use the TTS (Text-To-Speech) feature to read aloud the article;

  - the user can give a feedback for the article. It will be then used by the sorting
    algorithm (more on this in the Filtering chapter);
